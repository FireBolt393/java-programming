# Java Notes

This repository contains two Java files, `notes1.java` and `notes2.java`, that cover essential topics in Java programming, from basics to object-oriented concepts. These files are designed to be interactive, where users can uncomment blocks of code to test and understand various concepts.

## Contents

- **notes1.java**: Covers basic Java concepts.
  - All basic concepts.

- **notes2.java**: Focuses on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.
  - All important Object Oriented Programming concepts.

## How to Use

### notes1.java
- **Structure**: 
  - All code is commented out except for `public class notes1` and `public static void main(String[] args)`.
  - Each block of code is enclosed with block comments `/* */` for easy testing.
  
- **Instructions**:
  1. Open `notes1.java`.
  2. Find the code block you want to test.
  3. Remove the block comments `/* */` around that specific code block.
  4. Run the program in your Java environment.
  
  **Note**: 
  - Some variables may be declared multiple times across different code blocks. Make sure to only uncomment the sections you need to avoid variable duplication errors.

### notes2.java
- **Structure**:
  - This file covers OOP topics, and each example has its own `public class notes2` and `public static void main(String[] args)`.
  - Code blocks are commented out using block comments `/* */`.

- **Instructions**:
  1. Open `notes2.java`.
  2. Navigate to the code block corresponding to the OOP concept you want to explore.
  3. Remove the block comments `/* */` around that specific code block.
  4. Run the program in your Java environment.
  
  **Note**:
  - Table of contents: Topic names with their corresponding line are provided for easy navigation.
  - Each block in this file contains its own class and main method, so uncommenting everything will cause multiple class definition errors. Only work with one code block at a time.

## Important Notes
- These files are designed for interactive learning. Be mindful of:
  - Duplicate variable declarations in `notes1.java`.
  - Multiple `main` methods and class definitions in `notes2.java`.
- Test each block separately by uncommenting only the necessary sections to avoid errors.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Make sure to have JDK installed on your device.
3. Open `notes1.java` or `notes2.java` in your preferred IDE or text editor.
4. Uncomment the sections you'd like to test.
5. Run the file using your Java environment.

Feel free to explore the notes and learn by testing the different examples provided!
